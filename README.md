# Dank Nooner

## Current status:

- **Planning**
- **Start on fresh Godot 4.6 project**

## What is Dank Nooner?

**Dank Nooner** is a motorcycle stunt game built in Godot. The current V1 proof of concept is a simple wheelie balance challenge—hold a wheelie as long as you can and earn points to upgrade your bike.

The goal for V2 is a full rewrite expanding into an open-world 3D game. The physics should feel fun but challenging—managing clutch, throttle, and balance, with ragdoll crashes when you bail. Doing wheelies fills your boost meter. Planned features include upgrades, customization, multiplayer (races, co-op, free roam), and eventually a story mode. In the story mode, you'll progress from a bicycle up to sport bikes, learning new tricks and completing missions along the way.
