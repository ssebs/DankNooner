## Notes
- [ ] weave through traffic doing wheelies to build clout
- [ ] Differentiates itself from Ride 5 (and others) since it's not just racing, it's tricks and stunting too.
- [ ] release dank nooner v2 demo MP on itch. This is p0 to get critical feedback about game feel
  - [ ] think of what should be in the demo, what modes, etc.
  - [ ] make sure it's fun & polished
- [ ] how to market the game?
- [ ] figure out: why should people play Dank Nooner. Gameplay is fun, but to what end?
  - story?
  - progression? Bicycle to low power bike to dirt to sport?
  - Modes? Singleplayer/progression + quick server play like GTA Online?
- [ ] think of clippable moments for dank nooner
  - [ ] e.g. first crash & ragdoll
  - [ ] e.g. first dank wheelie fx
  - [ ] going on your phone during a ride turns into a crash
    - [ ] why do you need to do this? Some menu? Tuning?
  - [ ] E.g. wheelie => 360 flip trick in trailer w/ friend crashing during a race
- [ ] trailer + free multiplayer demo out now!
  - [ ] high quality demo, only planned jank
- [ ] hooks
  - [ ] 2-3 seconds to get attention on short form
  - [ ] do all the stupid stuff on a motorcycle from the safety of your home
  - [ ] mom said don't do wheelies
  - [ ] real bike mechanics, real crazy tricks
  - [ ] high skill ceiling to perfect your tricks
  - [ ] entertain first, then promote
  - [ ] post on EVERY platform
  - [ ] highlight what makes it different
